# Software Assurance and Fortify

VA [OIS Software Assurance](https://wiki.mobilehealth.va.gov/display/OISSWA/) (SwA) performs design reviews, code security reviews, and code quality reviews. For code security reviews, SwA is interested in reviewing **release** versions of the software.

The tool used for the "[Secure & Quality Code Review](https://wiki.mobilehealth.va.gov/display/OISSWA/Frequently+Asked+Questions)" is Fortify.

## BIP Process

All BIP service projects are created as a collection of maven reactor modules. The process for managing Fortify scan results is:

1. Perform **scan** of the reactor modules - results of the scan are stored in the reactor (root) `/target/fortify` folder. This step is intended for use on _local_ and on the _build pipeline_.

2. Perform **merge** of the new `/target/fortify/*.fpr` into the `/*.fpr` root FPR. This step is intended for use on _local_. It allows a team to retain the accumulated suppressions, comments, etc. The file should be committed and pushed to the project GitHub repo.

## Install and Run Fortify

There are currently two ways to run Fortify from maven (assuming installation prerequisites are met):

1. The `fortify` maven profile: This profile is in early versions of bip-framework 1.x. **It is _deprecated_ and will be removed in a future version.** This profile does not help developers with FPR merge. To run the scan: `mvn clean install -DskipIts=true -P fortify`

2. The `fortify-sca` and `fortify-merge` maven profiles: These new profiles are the recommended method of activating fortify scans and merges. There are various ways to run them (recommended approach is outlined in [Install and Run Fortify](installation-help-guide.md#install-and-run-fortify)). Execute a full build first, then: `mvn initialize -Pfortify-sca` followed by `mvn antrun:run@fortify-merge -Pfortify-merge`

See [Install and Run Fortify](installation-help-guide.md#install-and-run-fortify) for more details.

## SwA Secure Code Review Submissions

If you used the `bip-archetype-service` pseudo archetype to create your project, the Origin project will have included a `local-dev/swa` directory with tools to automate and simplify preparation for SwA Secure Code Review.

For instructions on how to use the tools, see [SwA Preparation Script](../local-dev/swa/README.md).

## Technical Project Configuration Details for Fortify

This section describes technical details about the configuration and processes of Fortify on builds that are executed on local and in the pipeline.

#### Tools used

BIP projects run Fortify scans using the `sca-maven-plugin` and `sourceanalyzer` app. FPR merges use the `maven-antrun-plugin` and `FPRUtility` app. The maven plugins require that the Fortify binaries and plugins have been installed correctly. You should have installed this as part of the [Install and Run Fortify](installation-help-guide.md#install-and-run-fortify) instructions.

#### POM configurations

Fortify execution has been encapsulated in the `fortify-sca` and `fortify-merge` maven profiles. The BIP Framework provides the scanning profile for the service module projects through the `parentpom` projects. However, the service reactor project must declare its own scan aggregation and merge profiles in its own POM.

The Origin pseudo-archetype provides the necessary profiles to newly created service projects.

**Framework: Parent POM module scans**

The `bip-framework-parentpom/pom.xml` contains a `fortify-sca` profile that executes the Static Code Analyzer on an individual project. Any project that has this pom as its `<parent>` (e.g. the parentpom of your service app) will inherit this profile, so any module having the service app parentpom as its `<parent>` can automatically can scan itself.

**Service: Reactor POM scan aggregation & merge**

The service reactor POM should contain `fortify-sca` and `fortify-merge` profiles. As previously discussed above, these profiles perform the scan and merge functions for BIP projects.

These profiles can be copied and pasted into any BIP service project's reactor POM without any changes. It will just work.

The `fortify-sca` profile binds itself by default to the maven `initialize` phase, which means the scan can be run without performing a build. This is helpful if your project has already been built, and you just need to scan. If you want to build and scan in one step, simply specify the phase to bind the execution to. See [Install and Run Fortify](installation-help-guide.md#install-and-run-fortify) for an example.

The `fortify-merge` profile runs independent of builds. The only requirement is that a scan was previously run, and the FPR file exists in the reactors `/target/fortify` folder.

Incidently, these profiles appear in the reactor POM in BIP Framework as well, but are not inherited into service projects (services inherit from the framework parentpom).
